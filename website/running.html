            I'm .....tired...<br>
            Of holding on to you, it's time to let<br>
            My..... pride....<br>
            Go and learn to love myself again, yeah<br>
            I don't wanna wait another day, I've waited long enough<br>
            I'm ready I can see the sun, it's coming up<br>
            There's happiness on the horizon<br>
            I'm hopeful I can see the light, I've<br>
            Hesitated all my life but I'm all done<br>
            I'm done running from you<br>
           <p> {Spent my whole life in your shadow<br>
            Scared of who I'd be if I<br>
            Yeah<br>
            Said goodbye and I didn't have you here<br>
            I wish you well but I can no longer stand aside<br>
            And watch you sabotage the two of us<br>
            I love you to death, but I can't spend the rest of my<br>
            Life in this darkness, I'm..... done<br>
            I'm done}</p><br>
            I wish you the best, but I'm not interested<br>
            In giving you more of my life, I've already given you too much<br>
            I don't wanna lose ya<br>
            I don't wanna keep ya<br>
            I know that you mean well but when I fail I don't need ya<br>
            Rubbing my face in it and treating me like I'm less than you, tell the truth<br>
            You know I'd be better without ya<br>
            Been in your shoes, don't be a fool<br>
            And try to convince me that I'm the<br>
            Real issue, when you're the root to every problem<br>
            I love you but not enough to allow you to continue to drown the both of us, you're<br>
            Holding me back, you're pulling me down, you're making me hate myself, I<br>
            Don't wanna leave, but that's what I need, I ain't got a choice, I can't just<br>
            Let you deceive and make me believe that I don't deserve to be loved<br>
            I am not gonna stand aside<br>
            And watch you attempt to rob and steal and sabotage<br>
            What little faith I have left, yeah, haven't I sacrificed enough for you?<br>
            Hate seeing you cry, but I think it's time to let go and say our goodbyes<br>
            Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, but I am not gonna spend the rest of my life running<br>
            From you<br>
            <p>{Spent my whole life in your shadow<br>
            Scared of who I'd be if I<br>
            Said goodbye and I didn't have you here<br>
            I wish you well but I can no longer stand aside<br>
            And watch you sabotage the two of us<br>
            I love you to death, but I can't spent the rest of my<br>
            Life in this darkness, I'm done<br>
            I'm done}</p><br>
