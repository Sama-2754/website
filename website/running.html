            I'm tired
            Of holding on to you, it's time to let
            My pride
            Go and learn to love myself again, yeah
            I don't wanna wait another day, I've waited long enough
            I'm ready I can see the sun, it's coming up
            There's happiness on the horizon
            I'm hopeful I can see the light, I've
            Hesitated all my life but I'm all done
            I'm done running from you
            Spent my whole life in your shadow
            Scared of who I'd be if I
            Yeah
            Said goodbye and I didn't have you here
            I wish you well but I can no longer stand aside
            And watch you sabotage the two of us
            I love you to death, but I can't spend the rest of my
            Life in this darkness, I'm done
            I'm done
            I wish you the best, but I'm not interested
            In giving you more of my life, I've already given you too much
            I don't wanna lose ya
            I don't wanna keep ya
            I know that you mean well but when I fail I don't need ya
            Rubbing my face in it and treating me like I'm less than you, tell the truth
            You know I'd be better without ya
            Been in your shoes, don't be a fool
            And try to convince me that I'm the
            Real issue, when you're the root to every problem
            I love you but not enough to allow you to continue to drown the both of us, you're
            Holding me back, you're pulling me down, you're making me hate myself, I
            Don't wanna leave, but that's what I need, I ain't got a choice, I can't just
            Let you deceive and make me believe that I don't deserve to be loved
            I am not gonna stand aside
            And watch you attempt to rob and steal and sabotage
            What little faith I have left, yeah, haven't I sacrificed enough for you?
            Hate seeing you cry, but I think it's time to let go and say our goodbyes
            Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, but I am not gonna spend the rest of my life running
            From you
            Spent my whole life in your shadow
            Scared of who I'd be if I
            Said goodbye and I didn't have you here
            I wish you well but I can no longer stand aside
            And watch you sabotage the two of us
            I love you to death, but I can't spent the rest of my
            Life in this darkness, I'm done
            I'm done
