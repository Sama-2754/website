{Yeah, some days, I just wanna leave the negativity in my head<br>
I just want relief from my stress<br>
I just want relief from my stress<br>
Some days, I don't wanna see or<br>
Have a bunch of people to impress<br>
I just want relief from my stress<br>
Yeah, I just want relief from my stress}</p><br>
Late nights, starin' out the window doin' eighty-five<br>
Got my state of mind<br>
Yeah, walkin' on that grey line<br>
Hopin' that my stress dies<br>
It's like I hate it, but I love it at the same time<br>
Pressure pushin' me from all sides<br>
Insecurities of all kinds<br>
Yeah, I'm a hostage to my own pride<br>
Most important things in life to me are things I know I can't buy<br>
Yeah, it's me in phases<br>
<br>
I'm not in the mood, yeah, to meet another stranger<br>
I'm not in the mood, yeah, to have a conversation<br>
And talk about a bunch of things that I don't feel amazed with<br>
Gettin' too close to me ((woo)) could be dangerous<br>
I don't like the energy, I leave the situation<br>
All this negativity that I can't get away from<br>
All this negativity, I think I need a break from<br>
I'm thankful, but<br>
<p>{Some days, I just wanna leave the negativity in my head<br>
I just want relief from my stress<br>
I just want relief from my stress<br>
Some days, I don't wanna see or<br>
Have a bunch of people to impress<br>
I just want relief from my stress<br>
Yeah, I just want relief from my stress}</p><br>
Yo, this life got my head spinnin'<br>
Wonder what I'd do if I knew these were my last minutes<br>
Wonder if I had a week to live, would I stay trippin'?<br>
Wastin' every day that I had left tryna sell tickets<br>
Or maybe call my dad, say I love him and laugh with him<br>
Take a couple days and get away from this fast livin'<br>
I don't love my work the way I did<br>
Man, this whole business has got me feelin' jaded<br>
Friends I had, now they act different, it's all switchin', whoa<br>
Yeah, it's pretty hard to watch<br>
Things you used to love turn to things that you wish you forgot<br>
Real moments that make you question the things that you want<br>
It's got me growin' mentally, but stressin' me out 'til I drop<br>
Over the top is where I live on a daily basis<br>
I always find a way to find the bad in good situations<br>
It's sad, huh?<br>
Yeah, I live my life on the edge, don't want the meds<br>
I'm just tryna get relief from my stress, you know?<br>
Some days, I just wanna leave the negativity in my head<br>
<br>
I just want relief from my stress<br>
I just want relief from my stress<br>
<p>{Some days, I don't wanna see or<br>
Have a bunch of people to impress<br>
I just want relief from my stress<br>
Yeah, I just want relief from my stress}</p><br>
These stress levels are not healthy<br>
I'm waitin' for that call sayin' records are not selling<br>
I wonder when this all disappears and they forget me<br>
Will I feel like I found who I was or be more empty?<br>
I wonder, was I was wrong thinkin' this is where God led me<br>
Or did I get involved with somethin' that was too heavy?<br>
I drive until I'm lost and just sit in my car yelling<br>
My inner critic talks, I'm just hopin' that God helps me<br>
Just stop stressin'<br>
Yeah<br>
<p>{Some days (some days)<br>
I just wanna leave the negativity in my head (I just wanna leave it)<br>
I just want relief from my stress (yeah, I just wanna leave it)<br>
I just want relief from my stress}</p><br>
{Some days (some days), I don't wanna see or<br>
Have a bunch of people to impress<br>
I just want relief from my stress<br>
Yeah, I just want relief from my stress}<br>
Yeah<br>
Yeah, some days<br>
Yeah, some days<br>
I just wanna leave the<br>
I just wanna leave the<br>
