            {Even if we both break down tonight<br>
            And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry<br>
            I know everything will be alright<br>
            I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing<br>
            I just need}</p><br>
            A little time to show you I'm worth it<br>
            I know that I can be a difficult person<br>
            I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I'm workin'<br>
            Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it<br>
            Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon<br>
            Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you<br>
            Actin' like I'm gone, but we both in the same room<br>
            I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to<br>
            And I know I make you feel like you're at the end of your rope<br> 
            That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone<br>
            Just the pride talkin', isn't it? 'Cause both of us know<br>
            I'm the definition of "wreck" if you look into my soul<br>
            Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place<br>
            Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase<br>
            When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away<br>
            But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if<br>
            <p>Even if we both break down tonight<br>
            And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry<br>
            I know everything will be alright<br>
            I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing<br>
            I just need<br>
            Time (oh)<br>
            I, I need time (oh, oh)<br>
            I just need time (oh)<br>
            I, I need time (oh)<br>
            Time (oh), time (oh</p>)<br>
            Yeah, way before I bought you the ring<br>
            We were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing<br>
            Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think<br>
            Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree<br>
            You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat<br>
            Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything<br>
            Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me<br>
            Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet<br>
            Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it<br>
            Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em<br>
            Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'<br>
            When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments<br>
            And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest<br>
            Making it difficult for me to open up and connect<br>
            Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress<br>
            That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if-<br>
            <p>Even if we both break down tonight<br>
            And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry<br>
            I know everything will be alright<br>
            I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing<br>
            I just need<br>
            Time (oh)</p><br>
            I, I need time (oh, oh)<br>
            I just need time (oh)<br>
            I, I need time (oh)<br>
            Time (oh), time (oh)<br>
            I just need time (oh)<br>
            I, I need time (oh, oh)<br>
            I just need time (oh)<br>
            I, I need time (oh)<br> 
            Time (oh), time (oh)<br>
