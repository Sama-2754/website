            Look, I don't know what's gotten into me<br>
            I could be off of my rocker potentially<br>
            Bigger I get, the more they thinkin' less of me<br>
            Don't be the one to insult my integrity<br>
            Put down the whistle, I'm done with you referees<br>
            Y'all don't know nothing, you think you ejected me<br>
            'Til I show up in the game, like, "Remember me?"<br>
            I gotta make it, these people depend on me (Pay, pay, pay)<br>
            Ayy, that's how I'm living these days (Woo)<br>
            Threaten my wife, keep digging that grave<br>
            I had a job making minimum wage<br>
            Told myself that I gotta get paid<br>
            Prove myself, yeah, get up my grades<br>
            Walk into class like, "Gimme that A" (A)<br>
            Think I'm trash? Put a bag in your face<br>
            And I put you by the road like, "Look what it's saying"<br>
            Here's a reminder that I still spit<br>
            Think I need to advise you to watch your lip<br>
            Or at least realize that I'm not no kid<br>
            Don't Google my name tryna find my crib<br>
            Write a pop song, then I write a song like this<br>
            Do a lot wrong? Doesn't matter, I learn quick<br>
            I'm an outlaw, my brain has no fence<br>
            Doesn't matter either way to me 'cause even if it did I would destroy it<br>
            <br> (Woo) (Woo) (Woo)<br>
            <br>
            Used to be employee, now I'm employer<br>
            Making big deals, now I gotta get lawyers<br>
            People tell me to relax and enjoy it<br>
            But when I kick back, I see warnings<br>
            So much time might pass, can't ignore it<br>
            Every time I rap and I'm recording<br>
            Might be my last so I absorb it 'cause...<br>
        </p>
            <p>I gotta make it or make it<br>
            I gotta make it or make it, yeah<br>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            Man, these are the options, these are the options<br>
            <br>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            I gotta make it or make it, yeah<br>
            I gotta make it or make it (Ayy, ayy, ayy)<br>
            Man, these are the options, these are the options<br>
            <br>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            I gotta make it or make it, woo<br>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            Man, these are the options, these are the options<br>
            <br>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            I gotta make it or make it, woo (I gotta make it or make it)<br>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            Man, these are the options, these are the options (Yeah)<br></p>
            Tool bag without the pliers<br>
            Intros' without the choirs<br>
            New car without the tires<br>
            Music without the writers<br>
            UFC without the fighters<br>
            Smoking without the fire<br>
            Cigarettes without the lighter<br>
            Austin Powers, no Michael Myers, that's me (That's me)<br>
            If I ain't got the bars, you see<br>
            Something ain't right like I'm incomplete<br>
            Outcast, yes, I'm a different breed<br>
            If you disagree, make 'em all retreat (Woo)<br>
            Act like a boss when I compete<br>
            Take my thoughts into hyperspeed<br>
            When it's all gone and I hit my peak<br>
            At least I'll know that I took that leap (Ayy, ayy, ayy)<br>
            'Cause life is a process<br>
            And I am not here for the nonsense<br>
            Losin' everything I worked for likes to weigh on my conscience<br>
            That why I block out the comments<br>
            Who's next? Who's next?<br>
            I don't know, I ain't been watching<br>
            Closing my ear to the gossip<br>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            Man, these are the options, woo<br>
            <br>
            No forfeit, my course different<br>
            Changed flows and I'm bored with it<br>
            More livid, never more driven, I avoid timid<br>
            Try to tell me I could never be the G.O.A.T. of rap, I ignore limits<br>
            I was born with this, you're trippin' thinkin' I'm slippin'<br>
            I'm enjoying this<br>
            Look at me, I'm on the tour sellin' more tickets<br>
            Even if the fourth record didn't sell a copy, I'ma do it like a hobby<br>
            I ain't quitting 'til the Lord tell me (Lord tell me)<br>
            <p>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            I gotta make it or make it, yeah<br>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            Man, these are the options, these are the options (These are the options)<br>
            <br>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            I gotta make it or make it, woo<br>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            Man, these are the options, these are the options (Ayy, ayy, ayy)<br>
            <br>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            I gotta make it or make it, woo<br>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            Man, these are the options, these are the options<br>
            <br>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            I gotta make it or make it, woo<br>
            I gotta make it or make it<br>
            Man, these are the options, these are the options<br></p>
            Ayy, these are the options<br>
            Ah, these are the options<br>
            Woo, these are the options<br>
            Yeah, these are the options<br>
