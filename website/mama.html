            Ooh, ooh, hey<br>
            Ooh, ooh, oh<br>
            Ooh, ooh, hey<br>
            Ooh, ooh, oh<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Yeah, you ever make it up to the gate?<br>
            And if you did, I wonder is it a beautiful place?<br>
            Did He put his arms around you, make you feel like you're safe?<br>
            Did He grab you by the hand and say that things are okay?<br>
            I gotta know mama, did He show you some grace?<br>
            Give you a pass and tell you He would carry the weight?<br>
            Do you smile more, wonder what it's like when you pray?<br>
            Is He standing in front of you, so you can look at His face?<br>
            When you talk to Him does he talk back? (Ooh-ooh)<br>
            You ever have conversations about what you regret?<br>
            Or did it all go away once you got there?<br>
            Does each breath take you closer to God, would you say that you cry less?<br>
            Do you feel at peace yet?<br>
            Do you laugh more?<br>
            You feel like heaven is everything you could ask for?<br>
            I ever make it up there when I see you I hope you're<br>
            Smiling 'cause you deserve it, pray to God that you found joy, and always know that<br>
            <p>{You don't gotta cry, you don't gotta cry no more<br>
            I hope you're up there looking down on us with a smile on your face<br>
            You don't gotta cry, you don't gotta cry no more<br>
            I hope you're up there with God, feelin' loved and set free from your pain}</p><br>
            I look at the situation you had<br>
            Might of made the mistake of leavin', but it's makin' me sad<br>
            Thinkin' of you how you grew up, tryin' to cope with your past<br>
            Were you like me in your relationships and pushed away dad? I gotta know, mama<br>
            Did you think you were trash?<br>
            Somethin' disposable that nobody could love or be glad?<br>
            To say they was with you, that issue is a issue I have<br>
            That's why it hurt me when Brittani gave me those letters you sent, I barely read<br>
            Any of one of 'em knowing I'd let them go to my head<br>
            And get to me especially when I feel I related<br>
            Might not be around for my babies<br>
            But know when I say that I love you, that I mean it, okay, 'cause<br>
            Nobody's perfect, yeah, I guess we all fall short<br>
            And I can't hold this unforgiveness in my heart no more<br>
            So just know you're lovable to me and of course<br>
            You'll always be mama to us, so save a table for four, and know that<br>
            <p>{You don't gotta cry, you don't gotta cry no more<br>
            I hope you're up there looking down on us with a smile on your face<br>
            You don't gotta cry, you don't gotta cry no more<br>
            I hope you're up there with God, feelin' loved and set free from your pain}</p><br>
            Mama<br>
            You don't gotta cry, no<br>
            Yeah, I'm grown now, took me a while to see the bigger picture<br>
            'Cause if you were here today and I was talkin' with ya<br>
            There'd be a lot of tears of joy falling on my sweatshirt<br>
            Prolly followed by some apologies and mom I missed ya, yeah<br>
            I pray you see me down here lookin' up<br>
            Still got a lot of things that I need healing from<br>
            But I'll get there eventually, so don't you worry none<br>
            I just hope you finally got some peace and you feel happy mom, I love you<br>
