            Say you're there when I feel helpless
If that's true, why don't you help me?
It's my fault, I know I'm selfish
Stand alone, my soul is jealous
It wants love, but I reject it
Trade my joy for my protection
Grab my hand, I'm drowning
I feel my heart pounding
Why haven't you found me yet?
I hold you so proudly
Traumas, they surround me
I wish you'd just love me back
Say you're here, but I don't feel it
Give me peace, but then you steal it
Watch them laugh at all my secrets
Scream and yell, but I feel speechless
Ask for help, you call it weakness
Lied and promised me my freedom
Grab my hand, I'm drowning
I feel my heart pounding
Why haven't you found me yet?
I hold you so proudly
Traumas, they surround me
I wish you'd just love me back
Grab my hand, I'm drowning
I feel my heart pounding
Why haven't you found me yet?
