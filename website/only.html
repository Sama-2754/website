I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight<br>
I can't be the only—<br>
<br>
Yeah, does anybody feel like me?<br>
Show of hands, I don't need a lot, I just wanna find my peace<br>
Yeah, why you throwin' rocks, oh, you wanna kill my dreams?<br>
Okay, tell me everything I'm not<br>
You think I didn't know those things?<br>
Always been a little lost and I still might be<br>
Life's hard, but it's okay (Okay)<br>
Watchin' the comments feels like I'm at a court date<br>
How could I complain<br>
With a house like this and a car like that in the driveway?<br>
Half of what I say<br>
Kinda feels like a dream that I'm gonna wake from someday<br>
Wishin' that I'd pray<br>
A little more often and put more time into my faith<br>
Travel in my brain, woo, might find damage and no grace<br>
Things that I hold on to, but I won't say things that I won't let go<br>
So I chain my soul to the heartbreak<br>
Havin' a nice day, that's not a average in my case<br>
Stones like cameras in my face; glamour, it's all fake<br>
Love my job, but it might seem odd that I'm here 'cause I hate fame<br>
Yeah, pay my debt to me, throwin' threats at me<br>
They can't tell this connectin' me, it's affectin' me<br>
Hide that well, they'll write checks to me, but don't check on me<br>
By myself, always questioning what comes next for me<br>
I can't be the only—<br>
<br>
No, I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight<br>
No, I can't be the only—<br>
<br>
Yeah, if you made a list of people that you trusted<br>
Would you put your name down?<br>
Do you know who you are?<br>
When you look at life and you talk about yours, do you feel proud?<br>
Are you leaving a mark, or scared to make a bad impression?<br>
So you just go hide in the dark<br>
Livin' and playin' a part, knowin' regret'll come back tomorrow<br>
That's what it does, ain't it? Don't know what we're chasin'<br>
But we all do it, just a part of life, I guess we're all foolish<br>
Running after what we think will make us happy 'til it falls through<br>
And then we find out later it ain't what we wanted<br>
So we give up on it, then we pile the garbage<br>
And we watch it grow and find a drug and numb it<br>
'Til we hit the point that we can barely function<br>
Am I motivated? Is my music dated?<br>
Would I be the same if I was medicated?<br>
Even therapists say I need medication<br>
I avoid it, though, because I'm scared to take it<br>
Am I the only one that has a loaded gun<br>
That's full of doubts and memories to overcome?<br>
And I complain about 'em when they shoot at me<br>
But I know truthfully I like to load 'em up and let 'em—<br>
<br>
thud//// thud////<br>
<br>
That's so sad to see, that's so sad to see, I need help<br>
They talk passively, then come after me by myself<br>
Lost that half of me, God, there has to be someone else<br>
Don't feel bad for me, I just can't believe that I'm lonely<br>
<br>
No, I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight<br>
No, I can't be the only—<br>
<br>
There's gotta be somebody out there<br>
There's gotta be somebody somewhere<br>
That needs company, and it's comforting to know, know<br>
There's gotta be somebody out there<br>
There's gotta be somebody somewhere<br>
That needs company, and it's comforting to know<br>
<br>
I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight<br>
No, I (I) can't be the only— (Only)<br>
Can't be the only one who's lonely tonight<br>
No, I (I) can't be the only—<br>
