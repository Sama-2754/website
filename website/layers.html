            Yeah (ayy)
            I got layers to me
            I got plans, I got goals, I got tricks up my sleeve
            I got calls, I got deals, I got people to meet
            I got drive, I got soul, I got everything (ayy)
            I got scars, I got heart, I got family to feed (woah)
            I got people mad, I ain't who they want me to be (ayy)
            I got people I don't know tellin' me what I need (ayy)
            Yeah, I got loved ones sayin' that they prayin' for me
            I'm thankful for the prayers, I need more of those
            Put my hands together, bow my head and thank the Lord for (ayy)
            Everything He's done, yeah, ain't none of us immortal
            So while I'm still alive, I got so much to look forward to
            Addicted to the craft (woah), got no time to chat (woah)
            This a lil' somethin' to hold 'em over for what's next (woah)
            Even when I guess (woah), I get it correct (woah)
            Question my work ethic, that's a question you don't ask (no, no, no, ayy)
            Yeah, don't ever question if I hustle, work a double
            Drop a bomb on me, I climb right out the rubble, not a struggle
            Tossin' me under the bus'll get you muzzled
            Pop your bubble (pop)
            Throw your compliments right out the window (ayy)
            So unique with this
            I can flip the script and change the schedule, you'd still think that it
            Happened how it should've, keep it subtle, bunch of geniuses
            Put they heads together, try to huddle up, but still they sit
            Confused about how I learned to juggle (ayy)
            Toss around some concepts 'til I pick one
            Usually, I don't alter my traditions
            Foreign to me, hit 'em with the switch up
            I just had to get this out my system
            Been a handful, even with a mouth full of hand soap
            I still say what I want to
            Getting past? No
            Better chance beatin' Usain Bolt in my sandals
            To be candid, that's like puttin' minivans in NASCAR
            With a grandma in the driver seat with her hands up
            Show goes on even after the show's over
            To get past me, you would have to kill me (kill me, kill me, kill me)
            Ayy (kill me, kill me, kill me)
            Tossin' what you want aside for longevity, ain't meant to be
            If it causes everything to collapse and affects your heart heavily
            What's worth it and what's not?
            What's certain and which side would the coin flip to and land on?
            When you guess wrong, do you stand up or stand down?
            Even with a man down, I man up
            Well-rounded, held out for the right outlet
            Nine houses couldn't make me feel home, childish
            Me left see the outcome every ounce of my childhood
            Played a role in how I wound up with an outlook so crowded
            No knowledge, couldn't see through the piles of my problems
            Still piled up, past tense, man, I wish it was, but I've come
            So far so quickly
            In it for the long haul, it's routine
            Only thing I'm cool with losing is losing sleep
            And it's only cool with me
            If it means I get to watch my dreams
            Come true if I kept it brief
            Still you think it was a long story
            Recording half of the things I think would
            Take six years, prepare, 'cause the chance that you asked for
            Might show up at your door one night like, "I'm here"
            Gonna let me in or just stare?
            It's clear, yeah, six ain't enough
            That wouldn't come close to the content between my ears
            My layers have got layers
            My layers have got layers
