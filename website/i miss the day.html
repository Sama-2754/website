 Mmh, mmh<br>
Mmh, mmh<br>
I miss the days when<br>
I had a smile on my face and<br>
Wasn't so caught up in all of the small things<br>
Wasn't so adamant that I could handle everything alone<br>
And wasn't so cautious and always exhausted<br>
And actually listen to things that my heart said (heart said)<br>
Ridin' my bike, just ridin' my bike<br>
Not overthinkin' my life<br>
Not always wonderin' if I'm a likable person<br>
Or someone that nobody likes<br>
Not always stressin' 'bout money or losin' my job<br>
Or scared I ain't makin' a flight<br>
Not always goin' to bed every night<br>
With this knot in my stomach that never unwinds<br>
What happened to me? Yeah, what happened to me?<br>
When did I start to believe I wasn't worth it<br>
Then question my purpose to breathe?<br>
Wonderin' who I should be<br>
Happiness out of my reach<br>
Scared to get back on my feet<br>
Need to get rid of what's detrimental, but it's hard to let go<br>
When the thing that hurts you help you get to your dreams<br>
See, I miss the days when I wasn't so faded<br>
Love wasn't always invasive, I could embrace it<br>
Just innocent, waitin', not always livin' in anguish<br>
When did I break and become overtaken?<br>
What was the moment I caved and<br>
Gave away all of my faith and made a replacement?<br>
I miss the days when, I miss the days when</p><br>
<p>{
I miss the smiles we had when we were young (oh)<br>
I miss the memories of feeling love (oh)<br>
I miss us runnin' underneath the sun (oh)<br>
Staring out the window when the rain would come (oh)<br>
I miss the smiles we had when we were kids, yeah (oh)<br>
I feel like life was so much simpler then, yeah (oh)<br>
When we had joy and we were innocent (oh)<br>
I'd give it all to feel that way again, way again}</p><br>
Give me my mind back, yeah<br>
Give me my mind back<br>
The one that told me I was worth somethin' when I fall flat<br>
Yeah, fall flat<br>
The one that told me I was worth somethin' when I'm off track<br>
Back when my imagination wasn't in a cage and it was free to run fast<br>
Yeah, give me my mind back<br>
Yeah, give me my, give me my mind back<br>
Before it was hijacked and wasn't described as<br>
A place of limitation, always indicating I can't<br>
Handle everything from my past<br>
Handed anything it dissects 'til I'm depressed<br>
I know I'm blessed, but I'm cursed too<br>
Take me back when I was happy, but I wasn't actin'<br>
Vulnerable but didn't see it like some kind of weakness<br>
Or a thing that's unattractive<br>
Had emotion, but I learned to mask it<br>
Didn't know what I was runnin' after<br>
Didn't know the older I would grow<br>
The more I'd lose control and take in all the baggage<br>
It's really sad when everything you thought was stable crashes<br>
Everything you thought would take the sadness<br>
Really only made it deeper, got me off the deep end askin'<br>
<br>
Will we ever feel like we imagine?<br>
Will we ever feel like we adapted?<br>
Will we ever feel like we did back then?<br>
Just take me back when, just take me back when<br>
<p>{I miss the smiles we had when we were young (oh)<br>

Yeah, oh-oh-oh (oh) (had when we were kids)<br>
