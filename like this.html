Yeah,<br>
 holding back<br>
Yeah, I've always been good at that, unattached (Yeah)<br>
Waiting for what's coming next, things I know I should address<br>
I feel more together when I am a mess (Whoa)<br>
That's for moments that just came and went<br>
Made amends with you, then you overstepped<br>
That's a line you never shoulda crossed, you got no respect<br>
Stop with all the threats<br>
Like the more I get know you, I just know you less (Yeah)<br>
'Nother city I don't know well<br>
Feeling too much like my old self<br>
Backsliding, backsliding<br>
Got me in the sad feels, got me at a standstill<br>
Too much time alone is when it gets real (Ah)<br>
Future doesn't pop up, then the past will<br>
Outside, that's the rear view<br>
Now I'm going downhill (Yeah)<br>
Don't know who I'm close with<br>
Going through the motions<br>
Don't know who to trust when I (Yeah)<br>
<p>{I lie to myself and I, I can't handle it<br>
Why do I waste so much time on things that I can't fix?<br>
All these things I hold inside I just can't forget<br>
Thought that I could let this go<br>
But I ain't know that it would be like this, yeah<br>
Like this (Like this)<br>
I ain't know that it would be like this<br>
Yeah, like this<br>
I ain't know that it would be like this}</p><br>
Yeah, maybe I'm impossible to be with<br>
I know that you got a thousand reasons<br>
You prolly wanna leave, but don't know how, yeah<br>
I don't hear a thing when you yell<br>
Guess you like to hear your own voice, yeah<br>
Got me standing here with no choice<br>
I see they tryna gas, they got me all wrong<br>
Look, I'm doing my best to try to stay calm<br>
But I can't deal<br>
Feeling too much like my old self<br>
Backsliding, backsliding<br>
I just let the phone ring<br>
We ain't even close, please<br>
Throwing out opinions from the nosebleeds (Ayy, yeah)<br>
Lot of issues that you don't see<br>
Texts that I just won't read<br>
Play it off, it cuts deep though<br>
When I don't know who I'm close with<br>
Going through the motions<br>
Don't know who to trust when I (Yeah)<br>
<p>{I lie to myself and I can't handle it<br>
Why do I waste so much time on things that I can't fix? (Yeah)<br>
All these things I hold inside I just can't forget (Nah)<br>
Thought that I could let this go (Yeah)<br>
But I ain't know that it would be like this, yeah (Woo, yeah)<br>
Like this (Ayy)}</p><br>
I ain't know that it would be like this (I ain't know that it would be like this, woo)<br>
Yeah, like this (Like this)<br>
I ain't know that it would be like this (Like this), yeah (Yeah)<br>
Like this (Like this)<br>
I ain't know that it would be like this<br>
Yeah, like this (Like this)<br>
I ain't know that it would be like this<br>
