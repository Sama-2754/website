            Dear God, please !!!!!<br>
            hear me out  I know it's been a cou-ple years<br>
            Since I've reached !!!!!<br>
            out and said hello  I bet You're won-de-ring<br>
            Why I.. keep,<br>
            Obsessing on and stressing all the li-tt-le things<br>
            When.. I should be<br>
            Living life and soaking up the me-mor-ies<br>
            I know I've been, selfish I have,<br>
            No excuse to, give you it's true,<br>
            Hanging by a, thread's how I live<br>
            I don't know why but, I feel more comfortable <br>
            <p>{Living in my a-go-ny watching my self-esteem<br>
            Go up in flames acting like I don't,<br>
            Care what any-one else thinks, when I know truth-fu-lly   <br> 
            That that's the furthest thing from how I,<br>
            Feel but I'm too proud to open up and ask ya<br>
            To pick me up and pull me out this hole I'm trapped in<br>
            The truth is, I need help, but I just can't imagine who<br>
            Who I'd be if I was happy}</p><br>
            Yeah, been this way so long<br>
            It feels like something's off when I'm not depressed<br>
            I got some, issues that I won't address<br>
            I got some, baggage I ain't opened yet<br>
            I got some, demons I should put to rest<br>
            I got some, traumas that I can't forget<br>
            I got some, phone calls I been avoiding<br>
            Some family members I don't really connect with<br>
            Some things I said I wish I would of not let slip<br>
            Some hurtful words that never should of left my lips<br>
            Some bridges burned, I'm not ready to rebuild yet<br>
            Some insecurities I haven't dealt with, yes<br>
            I'll be the first to admit that I'm a lonely soul<br>
            And the last to admit I need a hand to hold<br>
            Losing hope, headed down a dangerous road<br>
            Strange, I know, but I feel most at home when I'm<br>
           <p> {Living in my agony, watching my self-esteem<br>
            Go up in flames acting, like I don't<br>
            Care what anyone else thinks, when I know truthfully<br>
            That that's the furthest thing from how I<br>
            Feel, but I'm too proud to open up and ask ya<br>
            To pick me up and pull me out this hole I'm trapped in<br>
            The truth is, I need help, but I just can't imagine who<br>
            Who I'd be if I was happy}</p><br>
            Don't know what's around the bend<br>
            Don't know what my future is<br>
            But I can't keep on living in<br>
            Living in my agony, watching my self-esteem<br>
            Go up in flames acting, like I don't<br>
            Care what anyone else thinks, when I know truthfully<br>
            That that's the furthest thing from how I<br>
            Feel, but I'm too proud to open up and ask ya<br>
            To pick me up and pull me out this hole I'm trapped in<br>
            The truth is, I need help, but I just can't imagine who<br>
            Who I'd be if I was happy<br>
            If I was happy<br>
            If I was happy<br>
