            Yeah (ayy)<br>
I got layers to me<br>
I got plans, I got goals, I got tricks up my sleeve<br>
I got calls, I got deals, I got people to meet<br>
I got drive, I got soul, I got everything (ayy)<br>
I got scars, I got heart, I got family to feed (woah)<br>
I got people mad, I ain't who they want me to be (ayy)<br>
I got people I don't know tellin' me what I need (ayy)<br>
Yeah, I got loved ones sayin' that they prayin' for me<br>
I'm thankful for the prayers, I need more of those<br>
Put my hands together, bow my head and thank the Lord for (ayy)<br>
Everything He's done, yeah, ain't none of us immortal<br>
So while I'm still alive, I got so much to look forward to<br>
Addicted to the craft (woah), got no time to chat (woah)<br>
This a lil' somethin' to hold 'em over for what's next (woah)<br>
Even when I guess (woah), I get it correct (woah)<br>
Question my work ethic, that's a question you don't ask (no, no, no, ayy)<br>
Yeah, don't ever question if I hustle, work a double<br>
Drop a bomb on me, I climb right out the rubble, not a struggle<br>
Tossin' me under the bus'll get you muzzled<br>
Pop your bubble (pop)<br>
Throw your compliments right out the window (ayy)<br>
So unique with this<br>
I can flip the script and change the schedule, you'd still think that it<br>
Happened how it should've, keep it subtle, bunch of geniuses<br>
Put they heads together, try to huddle up, but still they sit<br>
Confused about how I learned to juggle (ayy)<br>
Toss around some concepts 'til I pick one<br>
Usually, I don't alter my traditions<br>
Foreign to me, hit 'em with the switch up<br>
I just had to get this out my system<br>
Been a handful, even with a mouth full of hand soap<br>
I still say what I want to<br>
Getting past? No<br>
Better chance beatin' Usain Bolt in my sandals<br>
To be candid, that's like puttin' minivans in NASCAR<br>
With a grandma in the driver seat with her hands up<br>
Show goes on even after the show's over<br>
To get past me, you would have to kill me (kill me, kill me, kill me)<br>
Ayy (kill me, kill me, kill me)<br>
Tossin' what you want aside for longevity, ain't meant to be<br>
If it causes everything to collapse and affects your heart heavily<br>
What's worth it and what's not?<br>
What's certain and which side would the coin flip to and land on?<br>
When you guess wrong, do you stand up or stand down?<br>
Even with a man down, I man up<br>
Well-rounded, held out for the right outlet<br>
Nine houses couldn't make me feel home, childish<br>
Me left see the outcome every ounce of my childhood<br>
Played a role in how I wound up with an outlook so crowded<br>
No knowledge, couldn't see through the piles of my problems<br>
Still piled up, past tense, man, I wish it was, but I've come<br>
So far so quickly<br>
In it for the long haul, it's routine<br>
Only thing I'm cool with losing is losing sleep<br>
And it's only cool with me<br>
If it means I get to watch my dreams<br>
Come true if I kept it brief<br>
Still you think it was a long story<br>
Recording half of the things I think would<br>
Take six years, prepare, 'cause the chance that you asked for<br>
Might show up at your door one night like, "I'm here"<br>
Gonna let me in or just stare?<br>
It's clear, yeah, six ain't enough<br>
That wouldn't come close to the content between my ears<br>
My layers have got layers<br>
My layers have got layers <br>
